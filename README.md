# Java REST API Project

Welcome to my Java REST API project! This project is an implementation of a RESTful API using Java, Spring Boot, Maven, Swagger, JUnit, Rest Assured, and Cucumber.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a robust and scalable RESTful API built on top of the Spring Boot framework. It incorporates best practices for API development, including documentation with Swagger, unit testing with JUnit, and API testing with Rest Assured and Cucumber.

## Technologies Used

### 1. Java

Java is a widely-used programming language known for its portability, security, and robustness. It serves as the core language for developing the API.

### 2. Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a powerful framework for building Java-based web applications and microservices. It provides features for auto-configuration, rapid development, and production-ready applications.

### 3. Maven

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It manages project dependencies, builds, and documentation generation, making it easier to manage the project's lifecycle.

### 4. Swagger

Swagger is a tool for documenting RESTful APIs. It generates interactive API documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and consume the API endpoints.

### 5. JUnit

JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java. It provides annotations and assertions to write and execute tests for Java code, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the API's functionality.

### 6. Rest Assured

Rest Assured is a Java library for testing RESTful APIs. It provides a fluent interface for writing API tests, making it easy to validate API responses and behaviors.

### 7. Cucumber

Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It allows writing tests in plain English using Gherkin syntax, making it accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

## How to Use

To use the REST API provided in this project, simply clone the repository and import it into your preferred Java IDE. Build the project using Maven and run the application. The API documentation will be available through Swagger UI.
